# Description by Author - Kiryl Kuchko

The layout was assembled based on the mocap - https://www.figma.com/file/IUdQ5h239HV94vMiP98Ib4/Weather-for-RED-House-Softwear?node-id=0%3A1. Project based on responsive layout, but unfortunately, due to time constraints, not everything was done. Namely, a mobile version and adaptation for tablets, but everything over 768px is provided.

The Openweather API was used because Metaweather does not work. To demonstrate understanding of the principles of react and react components, in most cases I used a class approach instead of hooks, I can rewrite everything to hooks if you wish.

I also wanted to do that the search history would be saved in localstore, so that the history would be common for different sessions of one user, but did not have time.

Also, for good, needed to rewrite the styles to the sass / scss preprocessor, or rather, use them from beginning (a small omission), this would reduce repetitions in the code, as well as introduce mixins.

The entire development process was carried out with git version control.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
